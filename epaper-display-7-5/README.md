# E-paper display 
So this is inspired by many other projects and I'll try to list them below.[^1][^2][^3]

This is a work in progress and for the content on the display it will change many times going forward. 


## For this display I used:

- Waveshare E-paper ESP32 driver board
- Waveshare 7.5inch e-paper display. I got the v3.   
- IKEA picture frame is called RIBBA 13x18cm. The white border is a bit small and will hide a bit display area...
